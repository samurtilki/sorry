# Sorry...

I do not know where to start or how to write a blog that is comprehensive and non-repulsive to common people. But take this as a gentle warning about how things are working — and the dangers it will bring.

## Where It Begins

AI became publicly known with ChatGPT. When I first learned about AI nearly 10 years ago, I believed it was the way forward. I spent days and nights learning from scratch — every algorithm, model, and theory I could find. I was deeply interested in complexity theory and emergence in complex systems.

To me, we were hitting a wall with our reductionist approach to science and technology. Though we had successfully created real-world value from the symmetries in our universe, I believed we were ultimately incapable of handling true complexity. The current scientific approach, which follows from Kant, taught us to divide and conquer complexity without truly understanding how the whole system works. This worked astonishingly well — until now.

## The Criticism of Reductionism & Frequentism

*"Divide and conquer"* — in simple terms, this is how we evolved to create computers, send humans to space, and build the civilizations we know today. It aligns with our intuitive drive to find patterns and exploit symmetries.

But a system is not merely the sum of its parts. *“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”* I first learned this in my first biology class.

In 1997, when scientists launched the Human Genome Project, many believed we would soon cure cancer, eliminate disease, engineer perfect humans, stop aging, and attain everlasting prosperity. But there was one problem: **epigenetics**. Our genes are not simply strings of nucleotides. We are much more than that. Our cells are dynamic systems that evolve based on feedback from our environment and changing conditions — just like everything else in this universe.

This holds true across all complex systems. Dependencies and interactions are more important than the building blocks themselves.

As science became increasingly reductionist, it began to fail in key areas: billions were spent on string theory and particle physics, billions more on Alzheimer’s, cancer, and cell therapy research, and immense efforts were poured into bridging algebraic number theory and harmonic analysis. Scientists told us oils and eggs were bad for us, and allowed lead and microplastics into our food and air — permanently damaging our world and civilization.

To me, it was clear we were failing — and most likely headed toward mutual destruction, since our growth was dependent on continued scientific and technological advancement.

*"Correlation is not causation."*  
We lied to ourselves, and to the public, and created even more doubt about our credibility and what we can truly deliver.  
Sorry...

## Acceptance of Holism & Frequentism: Understanding the System Through Interactions

There has long been debate about whether it is logical to understand a system by studying its parts *or* by understanding how those parts interact. Historically, the East struggled with complex interactions and leaned toward simplicity and order. We evolved to believe everything follows an orderly pattern. We created religions and myths to reinforce this worldview — even to the point of killing those who disrupted our fragile mental models of the universe.

The West, however, succeeded by exploiting symmetries through understanding parts, enabling it to flourish and dominate other cultures. But today, we are more doubtful than ever whether this reductionist approach still works. The law of diminishing returns has set in; our civilization is stagnating under the weight of exponential growth.

## What is the Role of AI Today?

As I said, we are not capable of understanding more than three unknown variables in any given system. We seek absolutes, symmetries, and patterns. We are no longer capable of advancing our civilization by ourselves — we are stagnating, and everyone will be affected by this uncertainty.

We attempted AI many times: analog circuits in the 1960s, symbolic AIs in the 1980s, kernel-based methods in the 2000s. These approaches largely failed to deliver results. In fact, AI was banned from conferences even though it was achieving better benchmark results (LeCun’s 2008 paper).

The first undeniable achievement came in 2012 with **AlexNet**. Today, AI is embedded everywhere: in our toasters, fridges, cars, and every device we touch — driven by the forces of Big Tech (which I will address later).

AI is the future. It can advance civilization through **statistical methods** capable of modeling complex system interactions — not merely exploiting symmetries or inductive biases that currently limit us.

## How Much is Too Much? Scaling

I remember when researchers tried to design the best model architectures using small, labeled datasets. It didn’t work... but it gave us one key insight: **scale matters**.

When we scale AI with vast amounts of data, it can compensate for the inductive biases and symmetries we previously relied upon. Scaling even helps overcome some of the limitations of inductive bias.

*"The Bitter Lesson,"* as Rich Sutton described it, taught us that our desire for cleverly crafted methods was holding us back. Reductionism and frequentism were failing us. The way forward was to remove these crafted methods and simply **scale**.

When ChatGPT was released to the public, everyone suddenly became an *AI enthusiast, AI engineer, AI speaker, AI guru, AI something something*. People proclaimed that "prompt engineering" was the future, that "everyone will lose their jobs," and on and on.

Billions of dollars flowed into AI startups, hype cycles, moats, promises, and chaotic predictions...

## Bitter Lies & Hidden Deception

Here is a confession — something I fear to say, something that goes against today’s hype. I know it sounds stupid and unpopular, but I must say it:

Nobody is really seeking the truth. People want to hear what comforts them, not reality. The truth will shake our perception and disrupt the patterns we cling to.

I foresee a worrying future where common people will suffer while a small group of deceptive actors profits. These individuals are lying, deceiving, and creating a bubble of fantasy — frightening the public and monetizing exaggerated disaster scenarios.

They lie about things they know are untrue and create misinformation to influence public perception.

*"Autonomous cars will be ready next year."*  
*"All professions will disappear next year."*

**It’s a lie. A deception.**  
Created by what I call **MBA monkeys**, modern con men, tech bros. These people spin marketing stories that promise a non-existent future, making the public afraid of AI destruction, pushing for immediate regulation, predicting massive job losses — all to weaponize public sentiment for their own gain.

---

## An Unpopular Opinion

AI does not — and will not — work in the ways promised by the MBA monkeys and scammers. It is not capable of replacing doctors, software engineers, or anyone else — because of its **fundamental design limitations**.

Before you attack me, please read further:

AI works by creating **world models** using massive datasets created by humans. It efficiently stores data in a hierarchical, non-linear, probabilistic way — interpolating information based on the frequency of training data. This is the simplest definition of machine learning or AI.

AI was never designed to replace critical systems. It is *possibilistic*, not deterministic. It cannot extrapolate or reason about unknown or unseen paradigms. It also cannot continue learning and updating existing knowledge, as its training data and architecture are **static**.

It never really worked in the ways that Sam Altman, Elon "Nazi" Musk, Mark "Certainly" Zuckerberg, or the broccoli-hype machine Dario Amodei have claimed.

## Corruption, Scam, and Weaponizing the Masses

The true problem is not merely these scammers. The real problem is that many people *know the truth* and are not informing the public about this deception.

Silicon Valley has perfected the tactic of **overpromising and delivering nothing** — creating the richest con men in modern history. You know who they are.

Trillions of dollars have been wasted. Millions of innocent people have unknowingly invested their money based on false promises — with no one telling them the truth about what is really coming.

I feel guilty. I feel disturbed to the point that I cannot sleep at night. I know millions of people will lose everything because of these con men and scammers.

---

## It’s Not Just AI

It is not just these AI scammers. The same lies were told about cryptocurrency, NFTs, the metaverse, IoT, mindless automation, and other fads. AI is simply their last big deception.

Once again, they will overpromise, terrify the public, extract their money, and ultimately deliver nothing — this time with even greater consequences.

---

## Path to Destruction & Collapse

The AI bubble **needs to collapse** — now — before millions of people suffer and trillions more are wasted. The current path will lead only to tools for misinformation, public surveillance, and further enabling fascist and authoritarian forces.

I am truly worried about what will happen to common people in the coming years. I am sorry that millions of people will lose their homes and life savings. I am sorry to be part of this corrupt system. I am sorry you may not believe me today — but you will suffer tomorrow.

I am sorry.  
I am truly sorry.
